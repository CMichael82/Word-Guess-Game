# Word-Guess-Game

## Trilogy Boot-Camp Assignment 3

### Objective:
In this activity I used javascript to create a guessing game. The game randomly selects a word from the wordbank array. The user guesses (onkeyup) and the guess is compared to the letters in the word array using an if/then statement. If the letter matches it replaces one of the blank spaces. If no match, the users guesses are reduced. I created functions to check for a win (all letters matched) or loss (no guesses remaining), in either case the game resets. 

### Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery
